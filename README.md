Hey there reader, I wanted to learn programming as much as I can breathe.
Programming is so much fun as I can feel.

I actually have a lot of goals on this journey, first I wanted to be a web developer, next is I wanted to be hacker, then proceed to game developer, and lastly being a graphic designer. I don't regret choosing this field as I lived for it.
